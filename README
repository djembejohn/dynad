To get this to compile (hopefully) the following will work.

You will need a version of g++ that is recent enough to support c++11.

You will need STK (synthesis toolkit) and cmake installed.

STK is at https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/

In file CMakeLists.txt, update 
include_directories("~/Software/stk/include")
and
link_libraries("~/Software/stk/src/libstk.a")
to point to where you put STK.

In a terminal type
cmake .
and then
make

Good luck!
