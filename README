Dynad
=====

Dynad is a Dynamic Additive synthesiser. It generates sounds by adding
lots of waveforms to each other. These waveforms are generally sine
waves, but that can also be changed. It is still very much in
development, so it's a bit peculiar to my way of working.

Compilation
===========

To get this to compile (hopefully) the following will work.

You will need a version of g++ that is recent enough to support c++11.

You will need STK (synthesis toolkit), jack, and cmake installed.

STK is at https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/

In file CMakeLists.txt, update 
include_directories("~/Software/stk/include")
and
link_libraries("~/Software/stk/src/libstk.a")
to point to where you put STK.

In a terminal type
cmake .
and then
make

Good luck!
